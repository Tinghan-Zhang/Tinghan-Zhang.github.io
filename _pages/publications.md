* **Preference Discovery and Consumer Search**. Joint with Tobias Klein and Christoph Walsh.
  * Common assumptions in economics suggest that when making purchase decisions, consumers maximize their utilities with choices that reflect their true preferences. This assumption has been extended to their search behaviors. However, in reality, consumers can learn their preferences while searching in the market ("preference discovery"). This paper proposes a sequential search model incorporating preference discovery, utilizing consumers' checkout abandonment behaviors. The model is applied to an online cellphone market in Kazakhstan, and we estimate it using detailed click-stream data. Our findings indicate that consumers underestimate their price sensitivity by 29.2%. With preference discovery, consumers gradually discover their preferences. When consumers purchase, they are 10.6% more sensitive compared to their first checkout.

* **Discrete Choice Model with Optimal Sequential Search**. 
  * This paper proposes a series of conditions to fully describe the optimal solution in the market where product information is partially available and can only be revealed through sequential search. The structure built upon these conditions forms a static rank-conditional discrete choice structure, which is more empirically advanced than the quasi-static choice structure based on Weitzmanâ€™s (1979) Optimal Search Rules. We show that the structure is convenient for formalizing the joint probability of the observations, specifying identification arguments, and implementing estimation with a GHK-style simulator without information loss. The RCDC structure generalizes the choice structures when search data is limited, and is flexible for more complicated model variations.
