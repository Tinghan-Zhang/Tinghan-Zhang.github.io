* **Preference Discovery and Consumer Search**. Joint with Tobias Klein and Christoph Walsh. 
  * One of the most invoked assumptions in economics is that consumers know their preferences when making choices. Although theories and experiments in psychology and behavioral economics suggest that this may be unrealistic, there is relatively little evidence from the field on this question. In this paper, we use detailed clickstream data from a large Central Asian online platform to study the extent to which consumers learn about their preferences while searching for a smartphone. To quantify the speed at which this takes place and account for other factors, most notably that consumers obtain additional product information when they inspect product pages, we estimate a rich search model in which consumers learn about their willingness to pay each time they visit the checkout page. Consumers initially underestimate their price sensitivity and update it along the way. Taking this into account shows that consumers are more price sensitive than a standard search model would predict, and an intervention that prompts consumers to end their search early can lead to potential welfare loss.

* **A Partial Ranking Choice Structure for Optimal Sequential Search**. [Slides](/files/Partial_Ranking_Slides.pdf)
  * Traditional choice structures based on Weitzman's (1979) Optimal Search Rules offer limited support for empirical research on sequential search models (SSM). This paper introduces a series of conditions that fully characterize the optimal solution to the SSM in a static choice structure, resulting in a Partial Ranking choice structure. Using the choice structure, I demonstrate that the joint probability of consumer decisions in the SSM can be easily decomposed into independent conditional probabilities, facilitating the formalization of identification arguments and simplifying estimation implementation. Therefore, beyond the baseline model, the proposed structure accommodates incomplete search path data, additional information beyond observed search sequences, and structural change in consumers' search path.

* ** Endogenous Search**. 
  * Consumers typically search to resolve product uncertainty under imperfect information before purchase. Beyond product attributes and search costs, consumers' search decisions are generally assumed to be driven by unobserved pre-search taste, often considered independent of other product characteristics. However, the assumption of independence in pre-search taste remains unverified. Consumers may perceive a correlation between price and unknown quality information, introducing endogeneity between search decisions and product prices beyond their inherent preferences. This relationship can bias the estimation of consumers' search behavior. Building on the decomposition of joint probabilities in the search process from my previous paper, I developed an estimation method with the potential to address this issue.
