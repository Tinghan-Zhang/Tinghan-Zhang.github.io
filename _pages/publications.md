* **Preference Discovery and Consumer Search**. Joint with Tobias Klein and Christoph Walsh.
  * Common assumptions in economics suggest that when making purchase decisions, consumers maximize their utilities with choices that reflect their true preferences. This assumption has been extended to their search behaviors. However, in reality, consumers can learn their preferences while searching in the market ("preference discovery"). This paper proposes a sequential search model incorporating preference discovery, utilizing consumers' checkout abandonment behaviors. The model is applied to an online cellphone market in Kazakhstan, and we estimate it using detailed click-stream data. Our findings indicate that consumers underestimate their price sensitivity by 29.2%. With preference discovery, consumers gradually discover their preferences. When consumers purchase, they are 10.6% more sensitive compared to their first checkout.

* **A Partial Ranking Choice Structure for Optimal Sequential Search**. 
  * Traditional choice structures based on Weitzmanâ€™s (1979) Optimal Search Rules offer limited support for empirical research on consumer sequential search models (SSM). This paper introduces a series of conditions that fully characterize the optimal solution to the SSM, resulting in a Partial Ranking choice structure. The proposed structure offers greater empirical utility due to its simplicity and flexibility. Using this choice structure, we demonstrate that the joint probability of consumer decisions in the SSM can be expressed in a value-difference form, akin to standard discrete choice models. This formulation facilitates identification arguments and simplifies estimation implementation. Therefore, the proposed structure accommodates incomplete search data, additional information beyond observed search sequences, and various model extensions.
