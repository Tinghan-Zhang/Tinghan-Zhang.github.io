* **Preference Discovery and Consumer Search**. Joint with Tobias Klein and Christoph Walsh.
  * Common assumptions in economics suggest that when making purchase decisions, consumers maximize their utilities with choices that reflect their true preferences. This assumption has been extended to their search behaviors. However, in reality, consumers can learn their preferences while searching in the market ("preference discovery"). This paper proposes a sequential search model incorporating preference discovery, utilizing consumers' checkout abandonment behaviors. The model is applied to an online cellphone market in Kazakhstan, and we estimate it using detailed click-stream data. Our findings indicate that consumers underestimate their price sensitivity by 29.2%. With preference discovery, consumers gradually discover their preferences. When consumers purchase, they are 10.6% more sensitive compared to their first checkout.

* **A Partial Ranking Choice Structure for Optimal Sequential Search**. 
  * Traditional choice structure based on Weitzmanâ€™s (1979) Optimal Search Rules helps empirical research on the consumer sequential search model (SSM) limitedly. This paper proposes a series of conditions to fully describe the optimal solution of the SSM that form a Partial Ranking choice structure. The proposed structure is more empirically advanced in its simplicity and flexibility. With the structure, we show that the joint probability of decision-makings in the SSM can be written in a value-difference form as in the standard discrete choice model, which is convenient for specifying identification arguments and implementing estimation. The proposed structure is flexible for incomplete search data, extra information beyond sequence observations, and many tractable model variations without relying on the optimal search rules.
