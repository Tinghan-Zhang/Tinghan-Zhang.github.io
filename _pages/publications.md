* **Preference Discovery and Consumer Search**. Joint with Tobias Klein and Christoph Walsh.
  * Common assumptions in economics suggest that when making purchase decisions, consumers maximize their utilities with choices that reflect their true preferences. This assumption has been extended to their search behaviors. However, in reality, consumers can learn their preferences while searching in the market ("preference discovery"). This paper proposes a sequential search model incorporating preference discovery, utilizing consumers' checkout abandonment behaviors. The model is applied to an online cellphone market in Kazakhstan, and we estimate it using detailed click-stream data. Our findings indicate that consumers underestimate their price sensitivity by 29.2\%. With preference discovery, consumers gradually discover their preferences. When consumers purchase, they are 10.6\% more sensitive compared to their first checkout.

* **Discrete Choice Model with Optimal Sequential Search**. 
  * This paper set up a consumer discrete choice framework where product information is partially available and can be revealed through sequential search. I show that when consumers sequentially search following Weitzmanâ€™s (1979) Optimal Search Rules, consumers' decisions is captured by a rank-conditional discrete choice framework in which only the final choice matters. I show that under this framework, widely-used sequential search model can be regarded as a variation of the standard static discrete-choice model. I proved the identification conditions of the framework, and show how the models purposed in the past literature can be captured in this framework.
