I am a 4th-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Econometrics and Operations Research](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/economics-and-management/organization/departments/eor) at Tilburg University, School of Economics and Management. My supervisors are [Prof. dr. Tobias Klein](https://www.tobiasklein.ws/) and [Dr. Christoph Walsh](https://walshc.github.io/)

My research fields are Empirical Industrial Organization and Quantitative Marketing. My main research interest focuses on consumer search, where I develop and estimate structural models to understand consumer learning and behaviors better while considering solving information frictions through search in online markets. In my first project, I built an equivalence between the classic consumer search model and a rank-conditional discrete choice model without information loss. I illustrated the estimation methods of the model. In my second project, I utilize these methods to estimate consumers' preference change in consumer search with observational choice data. I make use of consumers' checkout abandonment, in which they overturn their prior search decisions with the posterior preferences. 

I will be available in the 2024/2025 job market.
