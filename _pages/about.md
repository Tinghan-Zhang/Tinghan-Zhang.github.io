Welcome! 

I am a last-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Econometrics and Operations Research](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/economics-and-management/organization/departments/eor) at Tilburg University, School of Economics and Management. My supervisors are [Prof. dr. Tobias Klein](https://www.tobiasklein.ws/) and [Dr. Christoph Walsh](https://walshc.github.io/). 

Research Fields
======
Empirical Industrial Organization, Quantitative Marketing, Applied Microeconometrics, Digital Economics. 

Research Interests
======
 - **Empirical Industrial Organization** with its application in **Quantitative Marketing**, focusing on how consumers make decisions through multi-stage pre-purchase actions such as search and learning in the presence of market frictions, including incomplete product information, distributional uncertainty, and forgetting. I develop modeling frameworks to quantify the impact of relevant market strategies, including one-click purchase, recommendations, reminders, and targeted advertising.

 - **(Structural) Econometrics**, with an emphasis on estimation methods for multi-stage discrete choice and ranking-based choice frameworks.

 - Digital Economics on Platforms.
