Welcome! 

I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Econometrics and Operations Research](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/economics-and-management/organization/departments/eor) at Tilburg University, School of Economics and Management. My supervisors are [Prof. dr. Tobias Klein](https://www.tobiasklein.ws/) and [Dr. Christoph Walsh](https://walshc.github.io/)

My research employs structural econometric models to quantitatively analyze online consumer behavior, focusing on sequential decision-making in choice contexts.

Empirically, my work originates from consumer search models and has expanded to incorporate learning, regret, repetition, and inattention in sequential decision-making. I leverage consumer clickstream data to estimate these models and generate marketing insights on how mechanisms such as recommendations and advertisements influence market competition and consumer welfare through decision-making dynamics.

On the econometric front, I refine the empirical foundations of sequential search models and develop low-computational-cost estimators. Building on these advancements, I extend the methods to a broader class of sequential decision-making models, including those used in my empirical research.

I will be available in the 2024/2025 job market.
