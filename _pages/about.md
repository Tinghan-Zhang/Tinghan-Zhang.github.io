I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Econometrics and Operations Research](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/economics-and-management/organization/departments/eor) at Tilburg University, School of Economics and Management. My supervisors are [Prof. dr. Tobias Klein](https://www.tobiasklein.ws/) and [Dr. Christoph Walsh](https://walshc.github.io/)

I am an applied economist specializing in Microeconometrics and Empirical Industrial Organization, with application in Quantitative Marketing and Digital Economics. My current projects focus on consumer search and learning, spanning both structural econometrics and applied microeconomics. In structural econometrics, I simplified the classic sequential search model, transforming it from a complex structure into a simple, flexible and broadly applicable structure for empirical study. In applied microeconomics, I quantify consumersâ€™ preference discovery in their search and purchase process, and evaluate its implications for market predictions and consumer welfare. 

I will be available in the 2024/2025 job market.
