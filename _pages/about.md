Quantitative Marketing, Empirical Industrial Organization, Applied Microeconometrics, Digital Economics. 

Research Interests
======
 - **Empirical Industrial Organization** with its application in Quantitative Marketing, particularly focusing on consumer sequential decision-making in choice environments. E.g., search, learning, regret, forgetfulness, inattention. I utilize clickstream data to estimate structural models and derive marketing insights for mechanisms like one-click purchase, recommendations and advertisements.

 - **(Structural) Econometrics**, focusing on the sequential search model and its broad class of variations. 

 - Digital Economics on Platforms.
