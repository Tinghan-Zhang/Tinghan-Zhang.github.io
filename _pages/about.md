Welcome! 

I am a last-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Econometrics and Operations Research](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/economics-and-management/organization/departments/eor) at Tilburg University, School of Economics and Management. My supervisors are [Prof. dr. Tobias Klein](https://www.tobiasklein.ws/) and [Dr. Christoph Walsh](https://walshc.github.io/). I develop structural models and estimation methods to analyze consumer sequential decision-making using clickstream data from online markets.

Research Fields
======
Quantitative Marketing, Empirical Industrial Organization, Applied Microeconometrics, Digital Economics. 

Research Interests
======
 - **Empirical Industrial Organization** with its application in **Quantitative Marketing**, focusing on consumersâ€™ sequential decision-making among available actions to overcome market frictions, such as search, learning, revisit, and recall. I use models to quantify related marketing mechanisms including one-click purchase, recommendations, reminders, and advertisements.

 - **(Structural) Econometrics**, focusing on adapting conventional demand estimation methods to sequential decision-makings.

 - Digital Economics on Platforms.
