I am a 4th-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Econometrics and Operations Research](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/economics-and-management/organization/departments/eor) at Tilburg University, School of Economics and Management. My supervisors are [Prof. dr. Tobias Klein](https://www.tobiasklein.ws/) and [Dr. Christoph Walsh](https://walshc.github.io/)

My research fields are Applied Econometrics, Empirical Industrial Organization and Quantitative Marketing. My main research interest focuses on consumer search, where I develop and estimate structural models to understand consumer learning and behaviors better while considering solving information frictions through search in online markets. 

In my first project, I empirically investigate preference discovery in consumer search. I build up a structural model that allows preference change throughout the search process. By utilizing consumers' checkout abandonment in the click-stream data in online cellphone sales, I quantify the effect of preference discovery net of the information acquisition effect in search. I find the consumers do underestimate their price sensitivity when they start search, and become 10.6% more sensitive when they purchase or leave the market. 

In my second project, I propose a rank-conditional discrete choice structure for the optimal solution in sequential search. Compared to the structure following Weitzman's (1979) Optimal Search Rules, my structure is empirically more advanced: it preserves complete information in the observation search sequence; it is more convenient for identification arguments and estimation implementation; it is flexible for data with either limited search information or more complicated ranking conditions. 

I will be available in the 2024/2025 job market.
