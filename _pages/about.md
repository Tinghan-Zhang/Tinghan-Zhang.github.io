Welcome! 

I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Econometrics and Operations Research](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/economics-and-management/organization/departments/eor) at Tilburg University, School of Economics and Management. My supervisors are [Prof. dr. Tobias Klein](https://www.tobiasklein.ws/) and [Dr. Christoph Walsh](https://walshc.github.io/)

My research applies structural econometric models to quantitatively examine online consumer behavior, with a particular focus on sequential decision-making in choice environments.

Empirically, my work builds on consumer search models and extends them to incorporate key behavioral elements such as learning, regret, forgetfulness, and inattention. I utilize consumer clickstream data to estimate these models and derive marketing insights into how mechanisms like one-click purchase, recommendations and advertisements shape market competition and consumer welfare through their effects on decision-making dynamics.

On the econometric side, I strengthen the empirical foundations of sequential search models and develop estimators with low computational cost. These methodological improvements enable me to extend the analysis to a broader class of sequential decision-making models, including those applied in my empirical studies.

I will be available in the 2024/2025 job market.
