        <p>The increasing availability of consumer search data offers new opportunities to analyze search decisions through sequential search models. Existing applications typically estimate the model based on the Optimal Search Rules \citep{weitzman1979optimal}, which prescribe how consumers should make decisions given their private evaluations formed in earlier searches. This requires estimation to simulate these unobserved evaluations, creating substantial computational costs and limiting extensibility. We develop a new representation of the optimal solution to a broad class of sequential search processes, showing that it can be equivalently expressed as a partial ranking over all feasible actions throughout the process. This representation eliminates cross-decision dependencies and simplifies estimation. Based on this representation, we propose a Rank-based GHK simulator that reduces simulation requirements while improving accuracy, computational efficiency, and implementation simplicity. The proposed method applies to extensions whenever a set of graphical conditions is satisfied. This encompasses a range of empirical settings, including estimating the model with various forms of incomplete search data and estimating models for more general multi-stage information acquisition processes, such as search and product discovery.</p>

        <p>One of the most invoked assumptions in economics is that consumers know their preferences when making choices. Although theories and experiments in psychology and behavioral economics suggest that this may be unrealistic, there is relatively little evidence from the field on this question. In this paper, we use detailed clickstream data from a large Central Asian online platform to study the extent to which consumers learn about their preferences while searching for a smartphone. To quantify the speed at which this takes place and account for other factors, most notably that consumers obtain additional product information when they inspect product pages, we estimate a rich search model in which consumers learn about their willingness to pay each time they visit the checkout page. Consumers initially underestimate their price sensitivity and update it along the way. Taking this into account shows that consumers are more price sensitive than a standard search model would predict, and an intervention that prompts consumers to end their search early can lead to potential welfare loss.</p>

      Out of Sight, Out of Cart: A Recall-based Model of Consumer Search

        <p>We develop a structural sequential search model that incorporates imperfect recall of information acquired during search. Imperfect recall naturally arises in search environments and limits consumers’ ability to make optimal purchase decisions. We identify imperfect recall using consumers’ revisit actions, which allow them to reacquire decayed information, and estimate the model using rich clickstream data from a large online smartphone marketplace. Our results show that imperfect recall substantially influences both consumers' search process and purchase outcomes. Counterfactual simulations indicate that modest reductions in revisit costs, via mechanisms such as bookmarking, comparison tools, or retargeting prompts, can meaningfully reduce suboptimal purchases. These findings highlight the role of imperfect recall in consumer search and provide guidance for interventions that improve consumers' decision quality.</p>

    <span class="paper-title">Higher Price, Better Quality? Resolve the Endogeneity in Search Decisions</span>
    <details>
      <summary>Show Abstract</summary>
      <div class="abstract-content">
        <p>Consumers typically search before making a purchase to resolve product uncertainty under imperfect information. A key factor driving their search decisions is their private evaluation of the product. However, this evaluation often exhibits an endogenous relationship with price, as consumers tend to associate higher prices with better quality. This creates endogeneity between search decisions and product prices beyond the consumer's price sensitivity in purchase. I developed a novel econometric method demonstrating how using instrumental variables can address this endogeneity, enabling accurate estimation of consumers' preferences in purchase.</p>
